## Client

- Client: Maria Codlin

- Department: Department of Anthropology

## Project Description

### Overall Goal

- Understand roles of 4 kinds of animals in ancient economy at Teotihuacan Mexico
<!-- were animals hunted from natural environments, anthropogenic environments, or raised for consumption in the city? -->

<br/>

### Specific Goals

-	Animals from BOAX and PATT had similar diets except Cottontails
<!-- (only Nitrogen values for cottontails differ between BOAX and PATT) -->

-	Cottontails have two or more distinct diets

## Data and Explaination

### Variables

- "Taxa", "Site" and "Carbon and Nitrogen Level"


### Explaination

- "Taxa" : turkey, cottontails, deer, and hare


- "Site" : BOAX, PATT  (two closely related sites)

```

## Carbon and Nitrogen Level

- Stable collagen, apatite and nitrogen isotopes level 

- These isotopes enter bones by eating and reflect the values of animals' diets


### Explaination

-	Carbon isotopes reflect level of human-grown plants in animals' diet
<!-- , such as maize (corn).  -->
 <!-- High values = more corn.  -->
 
    + Carbon isotopes from collagen are protein derived.
    + Carbon isotopes from apatite (carbonate) reflect whole diet. 
  

-	Nitrogen isotopes tell us about the protein value in animals' diet. 
<!-- Higher values = more protein.  -->


## Summary statistics

```{r summary_data, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

```

## Goal and Plan

- Make some EDA to compare the three isotopes levels in animals' diet

- Do t-test for the means and medians of isotopes levels.

- Fit a mixed effect model to analyse animalsâ€™ isotopes levels.
